			<h1>The Sziget Experience</h1>
			<p>This is a <i>purely personal</i> description of the 2013 Sziget Festival. 
			I can guarantee that each story actually happened, though.</p>
	
			<h2>Day -1: The Franz</h2>
			<p>
			> Eating with friends<br>
			> See a couple girls running away with a box of beers, clearly stolen <br>
			> Chase them to return some cans they lost along the way <br>
			> They don't want them back, gain two beers for free <br>
			> Return at the table, see friends with stranger <br>
			> Stranger says his name is Franz and that he's on coke <br>
			> Wtf guys, I can't leave you alone one second and this happens. <br>
			> Franz starts eating Giulio's Indian food <br>
			> Says his rice tastes like chicken shit when compared to Giulio's, throws it in the air <br>
			> Takes a shower with one of my cans of beer, drinks the other one <br>
			> Starts calling Kirillin's eterosexuality into question <br>
			> Asks for a smoke, no smokers among us. <br>
			> Franz leaves us to look for cigarettes, thanks us for the food <br>
			> Decide we're never gonna lose the next Franz for such a stupid reason again <br>
			> Buy cigarettes first thing the next night
